# 🚍 AS Transportation System

**AS Transportation System** is a **Java GUI–based desktop transportation and courier management system** developed using **Java Swing**. The system supports **Admin and User roles** and focuses on secure data entry, input validation, and file-based record management using **BufferedReader and BufferedWriter**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a **desktop-based transportation system** that allows administrators and users to manage package and courier information efficiently. The system emphasizes **data accuracy**, **secure input handling**, and **usability** through an interactive Java Swing interface.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Develop a **Java Swing GUI–based transportation system**
* Implement **Admin and User roles**
* Ensure **validated and secure data entry**
* Store and retrieve data using **buffered file I/O**
* Provide basic **package tracking and record management**

---

## 🖥️ Proposed System

The **AS Transportation System** is a lightweight **desktop application** developed in Java. It uses **file-based storage** instead of a database, making it suitable for academic use while demonstrating real-world transportation system workflows.

## 🔐 Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Login System

* The system provides a login interface for **Admin and User**
* Credentials are validated before access is granted
* Role-based access controls system functionality

---

### 4.2 User Input & Data Entry

* GUI forms allow entry of:

  * Package ID
  * Sender and receiver details
  * Package type and weight
* All required fields must be filled before submission

---

### 4.3 Input Validation

* Prevents empty or invalid inputs
* Ensures numeric fields contain valid values
* Displays error messages for incorrect data
* Improves data consistency and reliability

---

### 4.4 File Handling

* Uses:

  * `BufferedWriter` to store records
  * `BufferedReader` to retrieve saved data
* Maintains structured, readable transportation records
* Ensures data persistence between sessions

---

### 4.5 Package Record Management

* Save new package records
* View and search existing records
* Basic package tracking through stored data

---

## ⚙️ System Features

### 5.1 Admin

* Login with admin credentials
* View all transportation and package records
* Manage user-entered data
* Monitor stored courier information
* Ensure data integrity and correctness

---

### 5.2 User

* Login as a standard user
* Enter package and courier information
* View saved transportation records
* Track packages using stored data

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Java
* **GUI Framework:** Java Swing
* **File Handling:** BufferedReader & BufferedWriter
* **Architecture:** Desktop-Based Application
* **IDE:** NetBeans / IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
